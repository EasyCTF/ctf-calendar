            <p>As CTFs become more popular, it's important to create a central repository of CTFs. Thus, this site aims
                to remind CTF participants about upcoming events, as well as help CTF organizers get the word out about
                their competition.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, we may expand this site to include a way to index teams and track their performance, but as
                of now, it's simply a list of upcoming and archived events. Previously, adding to the calendar required
                moderated approval through pull requests in the Git repository, so this site will also require all
                user-submitted entries to be approved before they are added to the main calendar on the front page.</p>
            <p>If you are familiar with <a href="http://sctftime.org" target="_blank">CTFtime</a>, this site is similar
                in concept to CTFtime, but targeted at the high school level.</p>

            <p>No, we're not running around in a gym, tagging other players. Capture the flag contests, or CTFs for
                short, are intense cybersecurity contests where participants try to capture a piece of information. To
                do this, they must use skills to capture a virtual flag, usually taking the form of a string, like this:
                <code>flag{this_is_a_flag}</code>. In most jeopardy-style CTFs (like EasyCTF), participants are tested
                on their security skills in the form of web, binary exploitation, forensics, cryptography, and
                reverse-engineering challenges.</p>
